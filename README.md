# kevinblack.dev

This little site was built using the official [Payload Website Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/templates/website) as a base, and customized for my needs.

Technology used:
- Payload CMS
- Next.js
- Tailwind.css
- Vercel w/blob storage
- MongoDB

 It is made as a showcase of my experience, and a playground to learn a few new skills.
